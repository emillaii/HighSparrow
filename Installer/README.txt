You must install NSIS before starting to compile the installer.

All the essential files for deployment would be packed into one installer, with license, creating shortcut in start folder & desktop.
Further improvement would be one-button deploy and build installer with batch command.

1. Copy all the binary files into "deploy" folder
2. Run NSIS and start "Compile NSI script"
3. Drag .nsi file into the window
4. Test installer if necessary
5. Installer will be generated in current folder
